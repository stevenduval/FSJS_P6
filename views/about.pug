            | Hello World!  You found me &#128512;
          p
            | Over the past 15+ years I have always had a passion to enter into the world of web development as a full time career.  
            | I took a few classes in high school and I also took a few classes online but never thought I was capable of transforming a hobby/passion into a career.
          p
            | Fast forward to 2022, after years of working in Email Marketing, I started to realize more and more that I needed to transform my passion into a career.
            | I left the Email Marketing world in February of 2022 and have been working ever since as a Front-End Developer.  I am now taking courses to one day, become a Full Stack Developer.

            | Join me on this journey, shall you?
